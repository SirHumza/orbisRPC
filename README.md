## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎮 **Any games** | Names resolve on your console via Sony's TMDB — CUSA, zero per-game setup. |
| 🕹️ **Homebrew + retro** | Homebrew resolves via pkg-zone; PS1/PS2/PSP classics via a custom list. |
| 🖼️ **Real cover art** | Game art served per title, PlayStation logo when idle. |
| ⏱️ **True timers** | Survive reconnects and restarts, resume across quick game switches. |
| 🧠 **Self-learning** | First-seen titles are remembered, so later boots resolve instantly. |
| 🔄 **Self-updating** | Daemon updates land from GitHub releases with automatic rollback. No reinstall treadmill. |
| 📦 **Simple install** | Payload (`.elf`) install → token → presence. |
| 👀 **Your call what shows** | `show_firmware`, `show_idle`, `show_media`, `show_homebrew` — all on by default, each toggled separately. |

## How it works

The PS4 runs one foreground app at a time, so a normal homebrew app gets
suspended the moment you launch a game. orbisRPC avoids that by running as
a **background payload daemon** while games run in the foreground.

```
PS4 (GoldHEN)                              Discord
┌─────────────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐
│ orbisRPC daemon         │ TLS  │  your profile    │
│  BigApp+TitleId → game  │ ◄──► │  Playing Game    │
│  metadata/TMDB → name   │      │  [cover] [timer] │
└─────────────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘
```

1. The daemon asks the OS what's in front (`BigApp` → `TitleId` — one
   call, so identity and state can't disagree).
2. Looks up its title + cover (config → app.db → local files → Sony
   TMDB → pkg-zone for homebrew → raw ID fallback).
3. Connects to the Discord gateway over TLS 1.2.
4. Sets your activity with an elapsed timer; clears it when the game exits.

Details: [`docs/DAEMON.md`](docs/DAEMON.md) · full index at [`docs/`](docs/)

## Requirements

- Jailbroken PS4 on firmware **from 5.05 upto 13.52**, GoldHEN running.
- A way to send the payload (elfldr on port 9021, or GoldHEN BinLoader
  on 9090).
- A Discord account + your user token (see Install).
- Internet on the PS4 that can reach Discord (see Troubleshooting if not).

## Install (5 minutes)

> ⚠️ **No PKG — beta is `.elf` only.** Grab the latest test build
> (`orbisrpc_test-build-*.elf`) from the Discord
> (**[discord.gg/BWEyfcT7ZQ](https://discord.gg/BWEyfcT7ZQ)**). This is still
> a test build, not a full release — expect bugs, report them in
> `testers-chat`.

1. Before launching, delete the `/data/orbisRPC` folder from your PS4 if
   you have one there from an earlier build.
2. Put the `.elf` on the console at `/data/payloads/` (FTP it over, or
   USB) — that's where GoldHEN looks for payloads.
3. Launch it from the payload list. First run creates the config file,
   then says there's no token yet.
4. Open `/data/orbisRPC/config.json` and add your account token in the
   `"token": "SET_ME"` slot.
5. After setting the token, re-run the payload from `/data/payloads`.
   Launch a game and watch Discord. Give feedback in `testers-chat`.

After a reboot just re-jailbreak and launch the payload from
`/data/payloads` again.

**Upgrading test builds:** as usual, delete the `/data/orbisRPC` folder
before using a new test build — and you'll have to re-add your token in
the config.

**Auto-run (not recommended on test builds):** you can drop the `.elf` in
`/data/payloads` and add it to the autorun queue in GoldHEN settings, but
test builds change fast — stick to manual runs for now.

**Official release:** will ship a PKG installer that sets everything up
for you — including autorun and the nanoDNS exception fix.

✅ Firmware: confirmed working on 9.00 through 13.52 but older fimwares should work.

### What's in the latest test build (0.70)

- Increased ws gateway frame buffer cap to 32MB - should fix oversized gateway frame skipping issue for some users (hopefully🤞).
- fixed minor issue with frame draining.
- added notification for invalid token.

## What you'll see

| Where you are | Discord shows |
|---|---|
| In a game | `Playing <Game>` + cover + elapsed timer (+ firmware line) |
| Home screen | `PlayStation 4` + logo (`Idling on Home Menu`) |
| Settings | `PlayStation 4` + `In Settings` (game timer underneath is kept) |
| Browser | `PlayStation 4` + `Using Web Browser` (game timer underneath is kept) |
| Netflix & co. | `Watching <App>` |
| Nothing to show | Presence clears |

## Config

Only `token` (your Discord user session token) is required —
`/data/orbisRPC/config.json`. Everything else ships working. Full
reference: [`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md).

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | — | Discord user session token (**required**) |
| `presence_state` | `"On PS4"` | Activity state line for games and the home screen |
| `presence_settings_text` | `"In Settings"` | Activity name while Settings is open |
| `poll_interval_s` | `12` | Detection cadence |
| `home_art` | project logo | Idle tile artwork (URL or uploaded asset key) |
| `pkgzone_enabled` | `true` | Ask pkg-zone.com for homebrew names — sends the title id to a third party; set `false` to disable |
| `retro_enabled` | `true` | Ask the retro-games indexes for PS1/PS2/PSP names and covers |
| `show_firmware` | `true` | Show the `Firmware X.YY` line |
| `show_idle` | `true` | Post a presence on the home screen, Settings and the browser |
| `show_media` | `true` | Post media apps (Netflix, YouTube, Plex…) as `Watching` |
| `show_homebrew` | `true` | Post homebrew titles. Retro classics are **not** affected |
| `debug` | `false` | Verbose per-poll logging |

A `false` visibility flag still detects the title — it just stops telling
Discord about it, so a game underneath keeps showing. The exception is the home
screen: with `show_idle` off, a game that closes is cleared rather than left up,
since nothing is running underneath there.

Plus the self-learned `titles` map, which fills itself in as titles resolve.

## Support / Community

Questions, test-build feedback, bug reports: join the Discord —
**[discord.gg/BWEyfcT7ZQ](https://discord.gg/BWEyfcT7ZQ)** — and post in
`testers-chat`. No need to hunt for the link; this is it.

**Found an issue?** Come to the Discord server and report it to us —
we'll take care of it.

⚠️ **This is a beta.** Test builds are handed out on the Discord — join the
server to get beta access.

## Troubleshooting

Short version here; the full symptom-first guide is
[`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

**Game cover not showing on Discord?** It's your DNS blocker. Disable it, or use
[nanoDNS](https://github.com/drakmor/nanoDNS) with an exception.

To add the exception, open the nanoDNS config at
`/data/nanodns/nanodns.ini` and find the exceptions list:

```ini
[exceptions]
feature.api.playstation.com
.stun.playstation.net
stun..playstation.net
ena.net.playstation.net
post.net.playstation.net
gst.prod.dl.playstation.net
```

Add `tmdb.np.dl.playstation.net` so it looks like this:

```ini
[exceptions]
tmdb.np.dl.playstation.net
feature.api.playstation.com
.stun.playstation.net
stun..playstation.net
ena.net.playstation.net
post.net.playstation.net
gst.prod.dl.playstation.net
```

Once you're done, save and restart your console.

Also set your PS4's DNS to `127.0.0.1` so traffic actually goes through
nanoDNS — then reboot. (This is the step most people miss.)

**Still "can't connect to Discord" while the PS4 is online?**

1. Open the PS4 web browser and go to `discord.com` — if that doesn't load,
   it's your connection, not the payload.
2. Delete `/data/orbisRPC/log.txt`, restart the console, run the payload
   again.
3. If it still fails, send the new `log.txt` in `testers-chat`.

**Known issues (test build)**

- Some homebrew (Apollo Save Tool, Cheats Manager, Homebrew Store) isn't
  detected yet — under investigation.

## Building

```bash
./scripts/build_sdk_from_source.sh   # SDK from git (REQUIRED - see note)
PS4_SDK_SRC=~/ps4-payload-sdk-src \
PS4_PAYLOAD_SDK=~/ps4-payload-sdk ./scripts/build_sdk.sh   # daemon payload
make -f installer/Makefile        # Setup PKG (OpenOrbis toolchain, llvmshim)
make -C tests test                # host unit tests
make -C tests asan                # ASan/UBSan
python3 tests/e2e_consumer.py     # contracts + linkage gate
```

⚠️ **Build the SDK from git, not the release ZIP.** The SDK's CRT refuses to
start on firmware it does not list, and terminates the payload before `main()`
with no log line. The released SDK (v0.9) lists 13.50 but not 13.52, so a
ZIP-built payload cannot boot on 13.52. See
[`docs/research/sdk-13.52.md`](docs/research/sdk-13.52.md).

Build/test/CI details: [`docs/BUILDING.md`](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Developing

- CI runs host tests, ASan, contract checks, the SDK payload build with a
  linkage gate, and uploads the `.elf` as an artifact. Tagging `v*`
  attaches it to a GitHub Release.
- Contributor notes: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Security notes:
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- PRs need the host suite green with outputs pasted (see the PR template).
- Daemon changes need on-console proof: log lines + firmware tested.

## Safety

- A user session token grants full account access — never share the config,
  never commit a real token. CI scans for token-shaped strings and fails.
- Token-based presence is against Discord's ToS (standard practice for
  headless presence tools; risk is yours).
